it's been almost 2 months since i started, i started learning swift at 23 of November last year with 100 Days Of Swift Course on hackingwithswift.com , it was not easy for first two weeks cause i had no any coding or programming background but as i countinue to work on projects i started to understand more. it's a lot easier when you do it instead of watching. i have done 2 projects on this course from day 16 to 21 and now i am at day 22 called Project 3. as i finish my projects , i will be sharing them in Projects folder along the way.
